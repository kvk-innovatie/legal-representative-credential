# Legal Representative credential

A "Legal Representative" credential lives in a natural person wallet and is used by a physical person to prove to a relying party that he/she are legally authorized to represent his/her organization.

The repository contains the SD-JWT VC Type Metadata of the "Legal representative" credential type issued by the Dutch chamber of commerce (KVK), but aimed to be compatible with European standards (as far as they exist). This credential is primarily based on [proposals of credential schemas](https://github.com/EWC-consortium/eudi-wallet-rulebooks-and-schemas) that are currently being developed within the EWC LSP consortium.
